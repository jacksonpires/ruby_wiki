%p Start with a line containing 3 or more backtick ` characters, and ends with the first line with the same number of backtick `:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      ```
      Fenced code blocks are like Stardard
      Markdown’s regular code blocks, except that
      they’re not indented and instead rely on a
      start and end fence lines to delimit the code
      block.
      ```
