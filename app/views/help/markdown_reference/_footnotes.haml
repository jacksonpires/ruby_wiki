%p Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

      [^1]: And that's the footnote.
